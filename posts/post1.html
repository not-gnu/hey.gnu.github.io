        <p>
            Creating is fun and endearing. Literally as I am writing this first post, I am
            figuring out how the hell am I supposed to increase the line spacing between 
            paragraphs. If this bunch of text seem to not be "off," then you can rest knowing
            that I have successfully figured out a solution. :D

            So, welcome! I have a lot in my mind lately and I heard journaling is a great way
            to make sense out of your thoughts (presumably). Now, I had many options on the 
            best way to journal. I could have just bought a notebook? But nah, that's too old
            school and traditional. What about popping up Google Docs and collate them all in a 
            nice and nifty cloud storage?
